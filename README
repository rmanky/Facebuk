The Entity class is the parent of every Object that needs a name and an image. This allows us to implement the equals
method to function between possessions, pets, moments, and people.

The LivingEntity class is the parent of the Pets and Persons, and this class allows us to add functions that are shared
between Pets and Persons. These functions are addFriend(), getFriendWithWhomIAmHappiest(), getOverallHappiestMoment(),
findMaximumCliqueOfFriends(), and isClique(). All these functions are shared between Pets and Persons.

The Image class was given, but it just emulates an image path as a string.

The FriendRequest class creates a FriendRequest() between two LivingEntities, and it stores the two living entities
that formed it as local variables. It also features the approve() method to carry out the actual adding of friends.

These classes helped eliminate redundancy is functions that needed to be shared between two different kinds of Objects,
such as Pets and Persons, while still keeping some uniqueness to Pets when needed (like owner).
