In addition to writing Java code that models the objects and relationships described above, you also need
to describe your rationale for how and why you created the classes that you chose. In particular, in a README file,
for every class (abstract or concrete) that you use, describe why you use it and what purpose it serves within the
greater project. Since Person, Possession, Pet, and Moment are all required, you do not need to justify their existence.
